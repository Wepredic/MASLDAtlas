## Docker Architecture

### Dockerfile
The `Dockerfile` defines the application environment:
- **Base Image**: R-based image for Shiny applications.
- **Dependencies**: Installs all necessary R packages.
- **Application**: Adds the R Shiny app to the container.

### Docker Compose
The `docker-compose.yml` includes:
- **Volumes**: Maps the application directory to the container for seamless updates.
- **Ports**: Exposes the application on port `6868`.
- **Services**:
